 *  Projection creation date:  possibly 2013-2015
 *  Project revision date: 2022-04-29
 *  Project name: apSU // short for "Application SUPER UNHIDE"
 *  
 *  // this project's name may change at any moment
 * 
 *  Objection:
 *  Project was created as a result of constant infection from
 *  Win32:Atraps-PZ[Trojan] which would hide folders and files.
 *  During the time Avast Anti-virus was used to quarantine the said Trojan however 
 *  Avast was not correcting the folder structure to make hidden files and folders visible
 *  - hence the creation of this Project.
 * 
 *  A program called "HFV (Hidden Folder Virus) Cleaner Pro"
 *  can achieve the same folder/file structure correction as well as able to neutralize
 *  the above said Virus
